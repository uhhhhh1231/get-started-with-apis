# Get started with apis in javascript

First, download the main folder and run `npm install`. Once the two dependences are installed run `node index.js` in your visual studio code terminal to start the index file.

If you are hosting the apis on your laptop/pc you can access it by going to `localhost:3000/` in your browser.
